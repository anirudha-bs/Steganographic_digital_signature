# Steganographic_digital_signature

This tool digitally signs a given data(text) and encodes the digital signature with the signer's public key(a digital signature) into an image using steganography.
This tool can be used to verify the digital signature (authenticity of the sender) of the image as well as to send secret messages. 
Example X.509 certificate is added to verify the signed iamge (data encoded in the signed image is anirudha).
